# textSummarizer
a system for summarizing large amounts of text while keeping the intended meaning. 
Nowadays, the need of automatic text summarization has augmented due to the rapid increase in number of information on the Internet. Therefore, it is too difficult for users to manually summarize those large online documents. text summarization solves this problem. It represents one of the natural language processing applications and is becoming more popular for information condensation. It allows getting the important information while dealing with large collection of documents. A good summary captures the essence of a long work in a brief informative statement that can be read and digested quickly. This solution can be developed using either extractive or abstractive approaches that both aimed at analyzing the texts and generalizing summaries. Text summarization by abstractive approach is stronger because it produces summary which is semantically related but difficult to generate. However, text summarization by extractive approach is easier for the human to program and for the computer to understand.
This project is focused on the using the concepts of extractive summary to summarize texts. The discussion revolves around the extractive approach Text summarization techniques can be applied helpfully depending on the user's needs.
